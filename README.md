# Data-Science-Projects

The Projects in this repository is done as part of my academic study during my masters in data science and analytics from University of Leeds(2021 - 2022).

## Artificial Intelligence
This folder contains Projects about Image classification and Image Caption Prediciton using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network Respectively.
### Image Classificaion and Visualisation 
- Built a CNN model and trained it on ImageNet10. Craeted confusion matrix for Training set and Validation set. Used final training model to make predictions on test set(images with no class labels).
- Visualised the filters and feature maps of an image 

#### Skills and Tools
Pytorch, Seaborn, Matplotlib, CNN, Image analytics

### Image Caption Prediction
- Built a RNN model and training it on the image features(Extracted from Encoder CNN) with reference captions and finally use the trained model to generate captions on test data.
- Compared predicted captions and reference captions to check text similarity using Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) and cosine similarity.

#### Skills and Tools
Text processing, RNN, Pytorch, Text Comparision.

## Machine Learning 
### Credit Card Fraud
- Built a prediction model that is capable of detecting potential fraudulent transactions using Scikit-learn ML library in Python.
- Evaulated the performance of different models using precision recall curce and ROC-AUC curve.

#### Skills and Tools
Data pre-processing, Random Forest, Logistic regression, SKLearn, Upsampling and downsampling.

### Initial Coin Offering(ICO)
- Produced Models Predicting whether an ICO(which is a type of fundraising using cryptocurrencies as an offering in exchange for the fund) whether an ICO project will raise   funding successfully project will raise funding successfully.
- Prepared data for modelling and Evaluation.
- Performed data cleansing and imputation.
- Evaluated results of test set and train set using classification report, confusion matrix and ROC curve.

#### Skills and Tools
Data pre-processing and cleansing, Imputation, SKLearn,Pandas, 

### Heart Attack
- Built a prediction model using logistic regression and decision tree in R language to predict person has heart attack or not.
- Identified independent variables that has strong effect on output variable. 
- Used Akaike information criterion(AIC) for model selection.

#### Skills and Tools
Rpart, ggplot, R, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression

### Gold Medal
- Prediction of Olympic medals(2008 and 2016 year) based on national GDP and population using linear regression in R.
- Using the regression for the 2016 medal count, make prediction for the unknown results of the 2021 Olympic games.
- Used cross-validation to perform a model selection between (i) Population alone; (ii) GDP  alone; (iii) Population and GDP
- Used Akaike information criterion(AIC) for model selection.
- Compared the model selection done by AIC and cross-validation.

#### Skills and Tools
dplyr, ggplot, linear Regression
