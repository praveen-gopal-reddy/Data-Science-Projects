## Artificial Intelligence
This folder contains Projects about Image classification and Image Caption Prediciton using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network Respectively.
### Image Classificaion and Visualisation 
- Built a CNN model and trained it on ImageNet10. Craeted confusion matrix for Training set and Validation set. Used final training model to make predictions on test set(images with no class labels).
- Visualised the filters and feature maps of an image 

#### Skills and Tools
Pytorch, Seaborn, Matplotlib, CNN, Image analytics

### Image Caption Prediction
- Built a RNN model and training it on the image features(Extracted from Encoder CNN) with reference captions and finally use the trained model to generate captions on test data.
- Compared predicted captions and reference captions to check text similarity using Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) and cosine similarity.

#### Skills and Tools
Text processing, RNN, Pytorch, Text Comparision.

## Machine Learning 
### Credit Card Fraud Prediction
- Built a prediction model that is capable of detecting potential fraudulent transactions using Scikit-learn ML library in Python.
- Evaulated the performance of different models using precision recall curce and ROC-AUC curve.

#### Skills and Tools
Data pre-processing, Random Forest, Logistic regression, SKLearn, Upsampling and downsampling.

### Heart Attack
- Built a prediction model using logistic regression and decision tree in R language to predict person has heart attack or not
- Identified independent variables that has strong effect on output variable. 
- Used Akaike information criterion(AIC) for model selection.

#### Skills and Tools
Rpart, ggplot, R, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression
