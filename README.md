## Artificial Intelligence
This folder contains Projects about Image classification and Image Caption Prediciton using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network Respectively.
### Image Classificaion and Visualisation 
Built a CNN model and trained it on ImageNet10. Craeted confusion matrix for Training set and Validation set. Used final training model to make predictions on test set(images with 
no class labels).
Visualised the fileters and feature maps of an image 

#### Skills and Tools
Pytorch, Seaborn, Matplotlib, CNN, Image analytics

### Image Caption Prediction
Built a RNN model and training it on the image features(Extracted from Encoder CNN) with reference captions and finally use the trained model to generate captions on test data.
Compared predicted captions and reference captions to check text similarity using Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) and cosine similarity.

#### Skills and Tools
Text processing, RNN, Pytorch, Text Comparision.
